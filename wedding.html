  <p>Please come to that! We would love to celebrate us with you!</p>
  <h1>Y'all, I have questions</h1>
  <p>Cool, text or call us</p>
  <h1>When do I have to be in or out by?</h1>
  <p>Please do everything in your power to let us know if you'll be coming to the ceremony by March 1st, 2025</p>
  <h1>How do I get to Lucca?</h1>
  <p>You can fly into Rome or Florence and then take a train. We'll be renting a car.</p>
  <p>If you decide to rent a car <b><i>MAKE SURE ITS AN AUTOMATIC</b></i> unless you drive manual. Then maybe you can give me some lessons.</p>
  <p>No better place to learn how to drive, right Apollonia??</p>
